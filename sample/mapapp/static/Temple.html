    <h1>KUNDRATHUR MURUGAN TEMPLE</h1>
    <br>
    <hr color="black">
    <p>This is the only Murugan temple in Tamil Nadu where the God is standing in a north facing direction. This temple was constructed by King Kulothunga Chola II. I think it has around 100 steps but which is easily climbable comparing other hill temples. Vehicles (cars, bikes, autos) can also be driven up the hill.Once winning the demons in Thiruporur, Lord Muruga went to Thirutani in a joyous spirit. He placed a Siva Linga, performed pooja and meditated deep. The temple was subsequently constructed by the great Chola King Kulothunga Chola. Lord Siva, worshiped by Lord Muruga graces the worshipers in the name of Kandaleeswarar in a separate shrine.
        One of the famous Murugan temple in the outskirts of Chennai.This is the only Murugan temple in Tamil Nadu where the Moolavar ( main deity) is standing in a north facing direction. This temple was constructed by King Kulothunga Chola II. There are 84 steps to reach this hill temple. Vehicles (cars, bikes, autos) can also be driven up the hill right up to the front of the temple on the hill, for those that cannot walk up the 84 steps. The temple is very close to the outer ring road for those that need faster accessibility to the temple. Pallavaram to Kundrathur there are a lot of buses too but do not go all the way to the temple.
